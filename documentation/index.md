## Relax-and-Recover documentation
The Relax-and-Recover documentation is being revised and updated.

### Getting Started

This quick start guide will show you how to run Relax-and-Recover from the git
checkout and create a bootable USB backup.

Start by cloning the Relax-and-Recover sources from Github:

    git clone https://github.com/rear/rear.git

Move into the rear/ directory:

    cd rear/

Prepare your USB media. Change /dev/sdb to the correct device in your situation.
Relax-and-Recover will 'own' the device in this example.

*This will destroy all data on that device.*

    sudo usr/sbin/rear format /dev/sdb

Relax-and-recover asks you to confirm that you want to format the device:

    Yes

The device has been labeled REAR-000 by the 'format' workflow.

Now edit the 'etc/rear/local.conf' configuration file:

    cat > etc/rear/local.conf <<EOF
    ### write the rescue initramfs to USB and update the USB bootloader
    OUTPUT=USB

    ### create a backup using the internal NETFS method, using 'tar'
    BACKUP=NETFS

    ### write both rescue image and backup to the device labeled REAR-000
    BACKUP_URL=usb:///dev/disk/by-label/REAR-000
    EOF

Now you are ready to create a rescue image. We want verbose output.

    sudo usr/sbin/rear -v mkrescue

The output I get is:

    Relax-and-Recover 1.13.0 / $Date$
    Using log file: /home/jeroen/tmp/quickstart/rear/var/log/rear/rear-fireflash.log
    Creating disk layout
    Creating root filesystem layout
    WARNING: To login as root via ssh you need to setup an authorized_keys file in /root/.ssh
    Copying files and directories
    Copying binaries and libraries
    Copying kernel modules
    Creating initramfs
    Writing MBR to /dev/sdb
    Copying resulting files to usb location

You might want to check the log file for possible errors or see what
Relax-and-Recover is doing.

Now reboot your system and try to boot from the USB device.

If that worked, you can dive into the advanced Relax-and-Recover options and
start creating full backups. If you USB devices has enough space, initiate a
backup using:

    sudo usr/sbin/rear -v mkbackup

That's it. Your hard disk can now safely fail.
